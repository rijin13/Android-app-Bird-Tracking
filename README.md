An Android app for tracking birds

The aim is to develop an Android app which will be useful for Bird watchers. In case the user cites a specific bird, he/she can add this occurence with the app, add additional details or even link to more infomration about that.For those unsure about species, some easy-to-use guidance will also be provided. Moreover, the past observations data can be exported for sharing with others.
